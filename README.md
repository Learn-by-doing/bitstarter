## Getting Started

What you need:

* Node.js - https://nodejs.org/en/ - you can use any version (lts/current)

* Git - https://git-scm.com/downloads 

You need to get both Node and git working before moving on with the rest of the instructions.
Both have pretty straight forward setup guides so getting them working shouldn't be a problem.

1. After you get these 2 things working, you have to go to [https://github.com/Learn-by-doing/bitstarter](https://github.com/Learn-by-doing/bitstarter) and fork the git repository using these instructions [https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)

2. navigate to your project directory and run ```npm install``` to install all the dependencies required by the project

3. Run ```node index.js```

That's it!
